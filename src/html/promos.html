				<h3>Promos</h3>
				<p>Promotional messages are occasionaly used on the site, whether it’s to let the user know that there’s a sale on a certain furniture range, cheaper shipping or a big promo/ad for an M&amp;S app (see food promo below). In most cases, you shouldn’t be using a lot of promo blocks on the same page. They work a little differently to alert messages, thus different rules apply.</p>

				<h4>Small text promo</h4>
				<p>In this example, we have a promo for an offer/sale of a product. So, we use the M&amp;S promo/offer red colour. As this is a small promo, it’s purpose is purely to inform - but it should not be shouty or overpowering.</p>

				<p>Save 20% when you buy 2 or more pieces of selected furniture</p>

				<h3>Large full width promo</h3>
				<p>In this example, we have a promo for the M&amp;S cooking app. As the promo needs to have links to download the app, a heading, body copy and image of the app, it needs to be fairly large.</p>

						<promo-heading>Free app full of delicious recipes</promo-heading>

							Try our Cook With M&amp;S recipe app. It's packed with inspiration and clever features, such as built-in timers and personalised shopping lists. It's your helping hand in the kitchen.
