				<h3>Promos</h3>
				<p>Promotional messages are occasionaly used on the site, whether it’s to let the user know that there’s a sale on a certain furniture range, cheaper shipping or a big promo/ad for an M&amp;S app (see food promo below). In most cases, you shouldn’t be using a lot of promo blocks on the same page. They work a little differently to alert messages, thus different rules apply.</p>

				<h4>Small text promo</h4>
				<p>In this example, we have a promo for an offer/sale of a product. So, we use the M&amp;S promo/offer red colour. As this is a small promo, it’s purpose is purely to inform - but it should not be shouty or overpowering.</p>

				<p>Save 20% when you buy 2 or more pieces of selected furniture</p>

				<h3>Large full width promo</h3>
				<p>In this example, we have a promo for the M&amp;S cooking app. As the promo needs to have links to download the app, a heading, body copy and image of the app, it needs to be fairly large.</p>
			</header>

			<!--
				IMPPORTANT NOTE:
				The required responsoive behaviour would require a level of progressive source ordering
				that isn't practical. It's possible, but that's how you get legacy code that no one wants
				to touch ever again. So we'll double up on the promo text and hide/show accordingly. It's
				bulky, but it's simple. In production, this should probably be done with javascript.
