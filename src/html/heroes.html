				IMPPORTANT NOTE:
				The required responsoive behaviour would require a level of progressive source ordering
				that isn't practical. It's possible, but that's how you get legacy code that no one wants
				to touch ever again. So we'll double up on the promo text and hide/show accordingly. It's
				bulky, but it's simple. In production, this should probably be done with javascript.
