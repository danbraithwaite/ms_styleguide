		<h2 class="london">COPY BLOCK</h2>

		<p>Copy blocks can be used to break up image heavy sections or to give more detail about a promotion/product/collection. Copy blocks should not span the full widith of the page. Obviously this is dependant on browser width &amp; screen type (desktop vs mobile). For 1200px width, we should use 600px (50%) for the copy area. On mobile and tablet, you will most likely have to use the entire full width area. Try to keep paragraphs to the point and don’t ramble on.</p>
